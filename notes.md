# /dev/null is a so-called special device. It's a part of the linux OS, and it's a discard device. Everything you send to this /dev/null will be discarded. that can be usefull because now my output is pretty clean.

# help this will get the list of internal commands

# bash will start new bash instance (sup shell). every single command that you are going to run is starting a sup shell by itself.

# .bash_logout which can be used to clean up things when users are logging out. this is a file that is often forgotten, by the way. but if you want to make sure that some housekeeping is done when users are logging out, then this is where you need to look.

# If you aim is to optimize and ultimate, using a linux shell, learn bash.
